<h1>PersonalScripts</h1>

<p>This is just a collection of scripts that I have written and would like to keep track of.<br/>
Some of them are very one-off (like &lsquo;launch_pwsh.sh&rsquo;) while others are more complex.<br/>
This includes utilities written for other applications (like lemonbar).</p>

<h2>Explanations of More Important Scripts:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lemonbar: script that runs lemonbar with slstatus as a monitor<br/>
as well as the config.h for slstatus</li>
<li>qtile_bin: collection of scripts that I use with qtile and it&rsquo;s widgets, startup, etc.</li>
<li>dmenu_status: a &ldquo;status bar&rdquo; using dmenu to display output from status scripts; cool for having<br/>
a status bar that stays hidden until needed, and it is easy to pipe the output into another script</li>
<li>get_current_group.py: for use with qtile; gets the groups that have windows and highlights the current group</li>
<li>dmenu_command.sh: a command launcher using dmenu; prevents me from having to install another application just<br/>
to run shell commands</li>
</ul>
