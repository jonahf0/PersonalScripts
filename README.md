PersonalScripts
===============

This is just a collection of scripts that I have written and would like to keep track of.  
Some of them are very one-off (like 'launch_pwsh.sh') while others are more complex.  
This includes of utilities written for other applications (like lemonbar).

Explanations of More Important Scripts:
---------------------

- Lemonbar: script that runs lemonbar with slstatus as a monitor  
as well as the config.h for slstatus
- qtile_bin: collection of scripts that I use with qtile and it's widgets, startup, etc.
- dmenu_status: a "status bar" using dmenu to display output from status scripts; cool for having  
a status bar that stays hidden until needed, and it is easy to pipe the output into another script
- get_current_group.py: for use with qtile; gets the groups that have windows and highlights the current group
- dmenu_command.sh: a command launcher using dmenu; prevents me from having to install another application just  
to run shell commands
